To connect to the MySQL database from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
mysql -h iliarudiak-macbook.local -P 3306 -u iliarudiak -p sakila
```

Then enter the password when prompted: `password`. Again, this is an actual password: `password`.

To connect as a root user, use:

```bash
mysql -h iliarudiak-macbook.local -P 3306 -u root -p
```

The password is the same as on the computer.
